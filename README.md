# AdoptMe
Android app for adoptin and listing for adoption animals.
!!!!THE APP IS UNFINISHED AT THE MOMENT!!!!

BASIC FUNCTIONALITY:
We are all familiar with dating apps (such as Tinder, Bumble etc.) where the profiles
of people appear on your screen as a deck of cards and you can swipe left or right
on each profile picture. The main idea of this app is similar, but instead of swiping
on people you'd be swiping on animals that are put for adoption in your selected area.

The app can be used for both: looking for pets to adopt AND listing animals for adoption.
If you are looking to adopt a pet, you would first create a profile and have a little 
description of yourself so that people who list animals for adoption can decide whether
you're a good candidate. Then you select the geographic area where you want to conduct
your search and choose what kind of animal you want to adopt (cats, dogs, birds, fish,
reptiles etc.). And then the app pulls all the profiles
of animals that match your search criterias and display the one by one on the screen.
Here you can start swiping. If you don't like the pet you can swipe left and the profile
will no longer appear for you, if you like an animal you can swipe right and it's profile
will be saved in your 'Favorites" folder. After you're done with swiping you can go to
the 'Favorites' folder and see all the profiles that you liked before, and here you can
make the decision and pick whichever pet you want to adopt. You will send an adoption 
request to the person who listed that pet and they will recieve a notification that
you are interested and see your profile details. Here they can either approve or deny 
your request. If it is approved you both will see each other's contact information and
then can communicate with adoption details. Once a pet is marked as approved for adoption
it's profile will no longer be displayed.
